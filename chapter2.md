title: ADACS introductory data analysis with pandas
description: >-
  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. This means the code is easy to read for humans and there is no need for us to compile it and in many cases we do not have to think too much about the underlying system fro e.g. memory usage.

This lesson is adapted from the Data Carpentry Ecology lesson. To work through this lesson we assume that you already have some basic understanding of python and jupyter notebooks. If you haven't worked with python before, or would like a refresher please check out this notebook.
